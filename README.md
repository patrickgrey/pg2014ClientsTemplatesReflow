pg2014ClientsTemplatesReflow
============================

A collection of Edge Reflow templates to help clients visualise responsive layouts.

This is part of my workflow when first meeting clients. I use these tools after we have established why they need the website and collected and structured their content.

Reflow is a great tool to show how designs have to adapt to different devices screen sized. It also allows us to quickly make content and layout changes to suit their specific requirements.

The stand in content is intentionally very plain to help the client concentrate on content and the end user, rather than bling. I would credit a Brad Frost article, [http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/html-wireframes/](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/html-wireframes/), for this approach, even though I don't use his excellent pattern lab.

I use the templates by selecting a template that closest matches the content we have developed, copy it and start playing about with it. I usually try to get the client to work on a mobile size page first so they get an idea how we have to really focus on the content we put in.

This has worked well, the only down side is that clients start thinking using Reflow is how easy website building is ;-)
